#Divide the list into a sorted and unsorted section
#Choose the smallest value in the unsorted section
#Place it at the end of the sorted section
#Repeat

[1,4,2,5,8,7]  1 - sorted [4 - 7] - unsorted

[1,2,4,5,8,7] [1 - 4] - sorted [5 - 7] unsorted

[1,2,3,4,5,7,8] - sorted


#Pseudocode: 

n = len(L)
c (c for cut-off) = 0 #start of unsorted list
m = L[c]
index = c
for i in [c, n]           #SEARCH
  if L[i] < m:
    m = L[i]
    index = i

  L.remove(index)
  L.insert(m,c)
